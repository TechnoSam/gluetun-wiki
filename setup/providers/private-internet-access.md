# Private Internet Access

## TLDR

```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -e VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER="private internet access" \
-e OPENVPN_USER=abc -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD=abc \
-v gluetun:/gluetun \
-e SERVER_REGIONS=Netherlands qmcgaw/gluetun
```

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    volumes:
      - gluetun:/gluetun
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=private internet access
      - OPENVPN_USER=abc
      - OPENVPN_PASSWORD=abc
      - SERVER_REGIONS=Netherlands
```

## Required environment variables

- `VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=private internet access`
- `OPENVPN_USER`
- `OPENVPN_PASSWORD`

## Optional environment variables

- `SERVER_REGIONS`: Comma separated list of regions
- `SERVER_NAMES`: Comma separated list of server names
- `SERVER_HOSTNAMES`: Comma separated list of server hostnames
- `PRIVATE_INTERNET_ACCESS_OPENVPN_ENCRYPTION_PRESET`: Encryption preset, defaulting to `strong`, which can be set to `normal`, `strong` or `none`. ⚠️ `none` disables the `cipher` and `auth` OpenVPN options.
- `VPN_ENDPOINT_PORT`: Custom OpenVPN server endpoint port
- `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING`: defaults to `off` and can be set to `on`to enable port forwarding on the VPN server
- `VPN_PORT_FORWARDING_STATUS_FILE`: File path to write the forwarded port number to. It defaults to `/tmp/gluetun/forwarded_port`.

## VPN server port forwarding

### Warning

In my experience, port forwarding with PIA is not really working for some reason. It seems to only work for p2p applications, PIA might be doing deep packet inspection on the forwarded port.

From [@ddelange](https://github.com/ddelange) on issue [#464](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/issues/464#issuecomment-1091966502), further confirming this:

> PIA replied that their service does not support incoming connections over a forwarded port.
> I also don't understand the answer (I was asking specifically about hosting a webserver on the forwarded port), because incoming connections on the forwarded port seem to work fine e.g. for P2P protocols

### Setup

First refer to the [VPN server port forwarding setup page](../advanced/vpn-port-forwarding.md#native-integrations).

Once enabled, you will keep the same forwarded port for 60 days as long as you bind mount the `/gluetun` directory. It will be automatically refreshed.

### Deluge

[@jawilson](https://github.com/jawilson) developed a plugin to automagically update the forwarded port in Deluge: [**deluge-piaportplugin**](https://github.com/jawilson/deluge-piaportplugin)

### qBittorrent

[@TechnoSam](https://github.com/TechnoSam) developed a docker container to automagically update the forwarded port in qBittorent: [**qbittorent-gluetun-port-update**](https://hub.docker.com/r/technosam/qbittorrent-gluetun-port-update)
